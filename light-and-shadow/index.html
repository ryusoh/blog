                        <p>In street photography, the time in a day is less crucial than in other genres, such as landscape photography. Street photography is formless. No one will tell you where the vantage point is like in a national park. No one will tell you when is the golden hour or the blue hour, which means you are bound to take better photos than at other times. You define your vantage point and best time.

<span id="more"></span>

<p>However, light and shadow are your great friends and subjects like any other photography genre. While you can shoot whatever you want, paying heed to the light according to the time of the day can add a whole new dimension to your street photography.</p>
<h2 id="Street-Photography-in-the-“Golden-Hour”"><a href="#Street-Photography-in-the-“Golden-Hour”" class="headerlink" title="Street Photography in the “Golden Hour”"></a>Street Photography in the “Golden Hour”</h2><p>It’s infrequent to hear “golden hour” in street photography because it’s not paramount. Instead, it’s the icing on the cake. However, there are some properties of golden hour light that you can bear in mind to leverage to make better photos.</p>
<h3 id="The-Shadow-in-the-“Golden-Hour”"><a href="#The-Shadow-in-the-“Golden-Hour”" class="headerlink" title="The Shadow in the “Golden Hour”"></a>The Shadow in the “Golden Hour”</h3><p>The golden hour is usually a one-hour window after dawn or before dusk. The angle between the sunlight and the earth is acute at that time. So the shadow can be quite long. You can leverage the long shadow to become the leading line in your composition.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>I took the above photo at the so-called golden hour in the late afternoon. The long shadow of the golden hour and the light trickling out from the shop window weave out a harmonic tic-tac-toe pattern. With these long shadows in your palette, you can unlock much more of your creativity.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF2212-2.jpg"><br>SFO Int'l Airport, San Francisco, CA 2021 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>The above photo taken at SFO is another example. The sunlight was flooding from the outside of the airport terminal. The almost earth-parallel light created a long shadow to lead your eyes from the lady to the info screen. The screen folded the shadow and made it hollow in the middle. The shadow and the lady form a pair of bookends, which makes the composition more balanced.</p>
<h3 id="The-Light-in-the-“Golden-Hour”"><a href="#The-Light-in-the-“Golden-Hour”" class="headerlink" title="The Light in the “Golden Hour”"></a>The Light in the “Golden Hour”</h3><p>In the high noon, the light is perpendicular to the earth, while in the golden hour, the light is almost parallel. So in the golden hour, light travels through longer distances than that in the high noon. It also means it penetrates through thicker air. There are numerous invisible particles like water steams and dust in the air. They act like natural diffusers. They will reflect and refract the light multiple times before it reaches the subject. It makes the light weaker, thus soft and gentle. From the above two examples, you can find out that the shadows are not pitch-black—no dramatic contrast. The textures of the pavement and the floor are still visible. The light gives you a warm and cozy feeling.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF4332.jpg"><br>Union Square, San Francisco, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>From the above photo, with the help of the golden hour light, we can see the texture of the gentleman’s hair. You can see the different layers of the hair, from the light part to the transition part and finally to the dark part. It’s like the gentleman’s hair is burning. It’s like David Lynch’s Eraserhead. Like a head of a revolutionary.</p>
<p>When the golden hour light is from behind the subject, it casts a soft, golden aura around the subject, which makes the subject more charming. At first, I will use artificial light to explain the mechanism.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF7243-4.jpg"><br>SFMOMA, San Francisco, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>I took the above picture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The setting was a dark room and a light source parallel to the floor. The light is similar to the golden hour, except it’s more concentrated and strong. But the mechanisms are the same here. Since the light is perpendicular to the subject, and the central part of the subject is opaque, the light can only make its way through the less dense fringe of the subject, e.g., the hair. And the light gets numerous reflections and refractions from the hair, which makes the light’s direction random. This mechanism creates an aura effect around your subject.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF7384.jpg"><br>Market Street, San Francisco, CA 2021 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>The photo above exemplifies the aura effect created by the natural golden hour light. I was walking down Market Street from the northeast to the southwest. The sun was sinking in the west. So the light was from behind the lady. The light setting here is comparable to that in the above SFMOMA example. You can see a golden aura around the lady as well. The soft light makes people look different. I also made the aperture wide open to allow more light into the camera sensor. So you can also see the facial details. It’s noteworthy that the German word for “glance” is “blick”. It makes juxtaposition with the lady’s eye contact.</p>
<h2 id="Street-Photography-Under-Hard-Light"><a href="#Street-Photography-Under-Hard-Light" class="headerlink" title="Street Photography Under Hard Light"></a>Street Photography Under Hard Light</h2><p>In street photography, photographers deal with hard light much more than golden hour soft light. If the weather is in intense sunlight, you will deal with the hard light most of the day. Therefore, investing your time studying hard light is a good bet if you are into street photography.</p>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-Hard-Light"><a href="#Characteristics-of-Hard-Light" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of Hard Light"></a>Characteristics of Hard Light</h3><p>Single and strong light sources create hard light. Hard light manifests everything under it and swallows details elsewhere. It creates a strong dramatic contrast and helps your main subject stand out. In addition, it helps to hide unnecessary details in the shadow to simplify your composition. You can dial down your aperture when the light is strong while keeping a high shutter speed. A small aperture keeps the edges of the shadow pin-sharp, making a dramatic effect.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF2774-2.jpg"><br>SOMA, San Francisco, CA 2021 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>In the above photo, with large blocks of shadow occupying the background, the white colors on the four people string up a slingshot curve. The curve leads your eye from the right-up corner to the left-down corner. The lady at the curve’s end is about to be flung out of the frame. There is also a less conspicuous red curve like a boomerang. The whole scene is like a stage show. The slingshot can only stand out with the hard light simplifying the composition. If the background is a bustling street full of people, this photo’s color and geometrical pattern will be drowned in the mundane.</p>
<p>The strong light creates unevenness on objects. You can tweak your camera settings to make the light underexposed. It can be a small aperture, a high shutter speed, or a low ISO. I prefer a small aperture over a high shutter speed in this scenario. It is because a small aperture (for example, smaller than f&#x2F;11) makes the edges of the shadow pin-sharp, which is more visually palatable to me.</p>

</p>

<p>The above photo is fine overall, but I am not satisfied with the fact that I was using a wide aperture so that the boundary of the shadow is watery. I prefer it to be sharp-edged. Since the sunlight was intense, an aperture of f&#x2F;16 would be ideal.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Applications-of-Hard-Light-Silhouette"><a href="#Advanced-Applications-of-Hard-Light-Silhouette" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Applications of Hard Light: Silhouette"></a>Advanced Applications of Hard Light: Silhouette</h3><p>The unevenness of the exposures creates a silhouette, with the main subject (usually human elements) underexposed and the background normally exposed. Since the background is so much brighter than the main subject, if you adjust your camera to make it normally exposed, the main subject will be underexposed, completely black.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF0921.jpg"><br>Gas Works Park, Seattle, WA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>In the above picture, all the people are blocking the sunset light and thus can’t get enough exposure. Eliminating the subject’s facial and physical features creates a mysterious and cold effect. Less is more. Sometimes the absence of details emits even stronger emotions.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/BD4D9453-16A7-4DC3-AE13-11F44BA9CFE3.JPG"><br>de Young Museum, San Francisco, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>This methodology also applies to a dark room with a lit wall.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF7219-2.jpg"><br>SFMOMA, San Francisco, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>Or a dark room with a lit floor, as long as the setting is that the background gets more light than the subject.</p>
<p>So with this basic knowledge, how do we shoot silhouettes in an urban environment? As we all know, the above settings are rare on the street. A hill without high visual obstacles against a clear sky? A dark room with artificial light sources? We don’t see them often in the city.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/hard_silhouette.png"><br>Shoot Silhouette on the Street © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>The above illustration shows the most common settings for silhouette street photography in an urban environment. As long as the sunlight is not vertical to the earth, it has an angle against the building. In the illustration, in Area C, since Building A blocks the sunlight, everything inside it gets less light than everything in Area D, which gets the full sunlight.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF5759-2.jpg"><br>Santa Clara Street, San Jose, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>So if you are shooting subjects in Area C against Building B, with the methodology we discussed above, you can have fun creating silhouettes. I recommend remembering this illustration in your mind and getting a general idea of the building heights, road widths, and the latitude of your city so that you know what time creates the best setting for shooting silhouettes.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Applications-of-Hard-Light-Chiaroscuro"><a href="#Advanced-Applications-of-Hard-Light-Chiaroscuro" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Applications of Hard Light: Chiaroscuro"></a>Advanced Applications of Hard Light: Chiaroscuro</h3><p>Chiaroscuro is a concept initially from oil painting. In Italian, it combines two words, “light” and “shadow”. In photography, it’s the very opposite of silhouette. For chiaroscuro, the main object is normally exposed, and the background is underexposed or completely blacked.</p>
<p>In the studio, it’s easier to produce such an effect. You can just cast light on your subject in a dark room to achieve that. The light can be artificial light or natural light from a small window.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>On the street, it’s a similar process to shooting silhouette, but in an opposite relative location. It would be best if you shot your subject in Area D against Building A to shoot chiaroscuro. Since the street-facing facade of Building A gets less sunlight than subjects in Area D, it creates an unevenness in exposure favorable to chiaroscuro.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF4282.jpg"><br>Financial District, San Francisco, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>The above photo is an example of street chiaroscuro. Chiaroscuro simplifies the composition by eliminating all the distractions in the background. It makes the main subject more eminent and the whole scene dramatic.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF3462-2.jpg"><br>Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>You can even leverage a flash to create chiaroscuro and completely ignore the natural light environment. You can underexpose everything in your frame, like almost pitch-black in your viewfinder, then use a flash to light up the subjects. It’s similar to shooting in a dark studio with a light source. I shot the above photo with a flash. You can see the above two images have a similar visual effect. But with a flash, you have much more freedom since you can control your light. Overclouded days and even nights can’t restrict you anymore. The obvious downside of the flash is that it’s more intrusive on the streets and not for everyone.</p>
<p align="center">
  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:0.7em"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryusoh/imagehost@master/DSCF0507-3.jpg"><br>Elliot Bay, Seattle, WA 2022 © Zhuang Liu</p>
</p>

<p>With flash, you can push the step even further and make your subjects overexposed. If the silhouette creates black sprites, overexposed subjects are white sprites. It also adds a mysterious hue to the scene and is sometimes better than being adequately exposed. No rules say adequately exposed ones are better than underexposed and overexposed ones, and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Light and shadow are your great friends in street photography. They enliven a mundane scene. There are infinite combinations between the light, the shadow, the subject, the background, and the exposure difference between multiple subjects. There are so many possibilities on the street, even if you live in a small town. With the concepts and techniques in this article in mind, you can observe the environment and practice composition even when you are not actively shooting. I hope you can enjoy the freedom and joy in street photography even more after reading this article, my friend.</p>
