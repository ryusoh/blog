### FAQ

- __How can you justify the price?__
At the end of the day, I am a street photographer. If possible, I would like to devote all my free time to street photography, which includes shooting, editing, learning, appreciating, and experimenting. Thus, most of the cost is attributed to the opportunity cost of street photography. I strongly recommend trying to find another commercial photographer with better service and a lower price first. If you can't find one, I can even give you pointers. That being said, once I accept your payment, I will do my very best for you.
- __Do I need to cover your transportation?__
No, if it's somewhere near San Francisco or San Jose, CA. You've already paid enough. However, if it's in a remote or obscure location, you'll need to cover the additional gas expenses for me or arrange transportation to get me there.
- __Can you conduct the photo session in languages other than English?__
Certainly. We can conduct it in Chinese (吳/漢/粵/台) or Japanese, whichever makes you more comfortable.
